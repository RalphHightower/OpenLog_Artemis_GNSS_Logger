### How to Contribute

Thank you so *much* for offering to help out. We truly appreciate it.

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis_GNSS_Logger/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis_GNSS_Logger/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you decide to add a feature to OpenLog Artemis GNSS Logger, please create a PR and follow these best practices:

* Change as little as possible. Do not sumbit a PR that changes 100 lines of whitespace. Break up into multiple PRs if necessary.
* If you add a new feature, please document how it works in the PR.
* If you add new functions also add them to _keywords.txt_ so that they are properly highlighted in Arduino. [Read more](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/libraryTutorial).
* Please submit your PR using the [release-candidate branch](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis_GNSS_Logger/tree/release-candidate). That way, we can merge and test your PR quickly without changing the _master_ branch
